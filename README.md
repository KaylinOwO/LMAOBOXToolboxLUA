# LMAOBOX Toolbox LUA
A set of tools/features for lbox via the new LUA API. **WIP** <br />
Will be adding as much as we can think of/am capable of when we have the time to spare.  <br />
Beware the menu code is a god awful mess for the time being.

# Features
Plyr Chams - The Nitro material is a replication of old Nitro chams (example: https://youtu.be/aLLKpvHxZBQ). The Shiny material is a version that's...shiny... <br />
Hands Chams - Same materials as Plyr Chams, will add more to both soon <br />
VM X, Y, Z - Adjusts the viewmodel offset/position <br />
VM Sway - Uses cl_wpn_sway_interp to adjust weapon sway <br />

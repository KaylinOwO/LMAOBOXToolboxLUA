# LMAOBOX Toolbox LUA
A set of tools/features for lbox via the new LUA API. **WIP** <br />
Will be adding as much as we can think of/am capable of when we have the time to spare.  <br />
Beware the menu code is a god awful mess for the time being.  <br />
**WARNING**: While I haven't tested it, I believe using VM X/Y/Z/Sway can get you banned from some community servers as it doesn't do any cvar spoofing.

# Modules
Chams Module - Contains Player & Hand Chams with 2 materials (Nitro & Shine), currently has performance problems. <br />
Misc Module - Contains Viewmodel X/Y/Z/Sway modifiers and Auto Melee. <br />
Crit Indicator Module - Contains a crit indicator based on Nitro's. Note that "Crit Ready" just means not crit banned for now. <br />

# Installation
Extract Toolbox.lua and the ToolboxModules folder both into %LocalAppdata% (C:/Users/username/AppData/Local)
You may delete any module you don't want from the ToolboxModules folder (except for the Menu module).

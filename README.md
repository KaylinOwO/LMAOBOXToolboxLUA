# LMAOBOX Toolbox LUA
A set of tools/features for lbox via the new LUA API. **WIP** <br />
Will be adding as much as we can think of/am capable of when we have the time to spare.  <br />
Beware the menu code is a god awful mess for the time being.  <br />
**WARNING**: While I haven't tested it, I believe using VM X/Y/Z/Sway can get you banned from some community servers as it doesn't do any cvar spoofing.

# Features
Plyr & Hand Chams - Nitro material is a replication of old Nitro chams (example: https://youtu.be/aLLKpvHxZBQ). Shine material is a version that's...shiny... <br />
VM X, Y, Z - Adjusts the viewmodel offset/position <br />
VM Sway - Uses cl_wpn_sway_interp to adjust weapon sway <br />
Auto Melee - Tempoarily removes your aimkey and enables autoshoot when your melee is out <br />
